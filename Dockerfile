# build cache, keyed by this mount's id — independent of --cache-from image
# layer hits. Even when a layer-cache miss forces this RUN to execute again

# ARG/ENV for the NEXT_PUBLIC_*/INTERNAL_API_URL build-time values live below

# value changing (they are re-derived from the live container's env on every
# deploy) would invalidate npm ci too, even though dependencies never
# changed. Only the layers that actually need these values — COPY . . and
# the build below — should be sensitive to them.
